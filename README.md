# Echo

Echo is a hackathon project developed during **IgniThon (K-1000)** under **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being**, focused on exploring how environmental data can be used to provide simple wellness-related insights.

## 🏆 Achievement
- **3rd Place** – IgniThon Hackathon (Beginner Category)
- Date: 24 August 2025

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Environmental factors such as weather conditions and air quality can significantly impact daily health and well-being. However, this information is often fragmented and not presented in a simple, actionable manner for everyday users.

## 💡 Proposed Solution (Hackathon Vision)
The proposed system aimed to:
- Fetch real-time weather and air quality data based on user location
- Provide basic wellness suggestions derived from environmental conditions
- Enhance user experience through mood-based music suggestions
- Present all insights through a clean, user-friendly interface

## ✅ Implemented Features
Due to hackathon time constraints, the following features were implemented:
- City-based weather data retrieval using a public Weather API
- Dynamic display of weather conditions for the entered location
- Mood-based redirection to pre-curated Spotify playlists based on weather
- A basic chatbot interface integrated using the OpenAI API

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js
- APIs: Weather API, Spotify links, OpenAI API

## 👤 My Contributions
- Implemented weather data fetching, Chatbot api and UI integration
- Worked on application flow and feature logic
- Assisted in debugging and overall project integration
- Contributed to ideation and presentation

## 🚧 Current Status
This repository represents a hackathon prototype built under limited time constraints. The project can be extended further with more contextual AI responses and deeper health-related insights.

## 📌 Note
This project reflects a learning-focused hackathon effort and is not intended as a production-ready system.
